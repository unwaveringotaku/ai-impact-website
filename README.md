This project includes a simple HTML page with images. Automated tests are
provided to ensure that all image files referenced in `index.html` exist in the
repository.

## Running the tests

Install `pytest` if it is not already available and run the tests from the
project root:

```bash
pytest
```

The tests do not require network access and only depend on Python's standard
library.
